### Hiya ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a software engineer with experience in UX Research and Music Technology.

I decided to learn how to code after participating in a workshop where I used a language called Littlefoot to make music on the Lightpad Block. I was blown away by the possibility of creating interfaces that make human interaction with technology fun and couldn't stop myself from exploring further!

Recently, I completed the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly, where I trained as a Full-Stack Engineer. 

Currently, I am looking for my first role as a developer in a collaborative team where I can share my creativity and learn from others ðŸ™Œ
